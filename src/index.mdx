# Getting Started

Welcome to Ample's Component Library! You're going to love it!

This library is a set of React components, built to play with Gatsby, and are designed to make you a happy developer.

Here are the basics you need to know before getting started:

## Installation

Install the library in your Gatsby project:

    $ yarn add https://github.com/ample/gatsby-theme-ample-components

Then add it to the plugins section of your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  // ...
  `gatsby-theme-ample-components`
]
```

## Usage

The components that you'll want to work with are all exported from the library's main file. Thus, they can be imported using their name. For example:

```js
import { Link } from "gatsby-theme-ample-components"

const MyComp = props => <Link {...props} />
```

## Contributing

### Developing Locally

This project uses the [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) Gatsby plugin to build out a doc site. This is a great place to test your components.

You may also want to plug your component into an actual Gatsby site before submitting a pull request. To do so, begin by telling Yarn to store a reference to this library and use the React version from your Gatsby project:

    $ yarn link && npm link ../gatsby-project-directory/node_modules/react

After following installation instructions for the library in your Gatsby project, you can then pull in the local code by running the following command from your project's directory:

    $ yarn link gatsby-theme-ample-components

### Submitting Your Code

After adding your code, [open a pull request](https://github.com/ample/gatsby-theme-ample-components/compare) for your code to be reviewed.

This will trigger a build via [the Netlify site](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-theme-ample-components), which runs the following commands:

    $ yarn lint
    $ yarn test
    $ yarn build

You may want to run those commands locally to make sure you're buttoned up before submitting a PR. Any addition or change to the components in this library should contain:

- Relevant `propTypes` and `defaultProps` properties on all components.
- Documentation of your work in all apropriate `notes.mdx` files.
- Specs for any logic-based methods.

# SEO

The `<SEO />` component makes use of [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to write meta tags to the `<head>` of the site.

Typically, this component will be included by the `<Layout />` component.

## Usage

There is no playground for this component, as it would overwrite this page's meta tags. See properties section below for options you can send to the `<SEO />` component.

## Properties

<Props of={SEO} />
